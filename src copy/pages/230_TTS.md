Thorium 2.3 TTS reads page numbers by default which might result in a too verbose earing experience. The `skipability` option in `readaloud` parameter does not affect TTS reading as expected. This is fixed in [2.4 alpha continuous test build](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/releases) and will be shipped in 2.4 release. 

</div>

Text-to-speech is launched using the speaker button in the middle of the toolbar, 
or by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>.

* Play and pause can be controlled with the keyboard shortcut 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>.

* The playback position can be moved with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> 
and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> for previous and next respectively.

* A speed control is available when read aloud 
is selected, with a range from x0.5 to x2.

* The current sentence is highlighted in light yellow, and each word spoken is 
underlined in orange.

* An alternative (simplified) view of the publication is provided through 
options available in the `Settings / Readaloud` menu.
